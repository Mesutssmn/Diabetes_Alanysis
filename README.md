Diabetes is a chronic, metabolic disease characterized by elevated levels of blood glucose (or blood sugar), which leads over time to serious damage to the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys and nerves. The most common is type 2 diabetes, usually in adults, which occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn't make enough insulin. In the past 3 decades the prevalence of type 2 diabetes has risen dramatically in countries of all income levels. Type 1 diabetes, once known as juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes, is a chronic condition in which the pancreas produces little or no insulin by itself. For people living with diabetes, access to affordable treatment, including insulin, is critical to their survival. There is a globally agreed target to halt the rise in diabetes and obesity by 2025.

***Dataset :***

**Pregnancies:** This represents the number of times the individual has been pregnant. It's a count of pregnancies, which can be an important factor in health, especially for conditions related to diabetes.

**Glucose:** This measures the glucose concentration in the blood. High levels of glucose can indicate diabetes or a risk of developing diabetes.

**BloodPressure:** This is the diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg). Blood pressure levels can affect and indicate overall health, including risks related to diabetes.

**SkinThickness:** This is the thickness of the skin fold at the triceps, measured in millimeters. It's a measure used to estimate body fat. (mm)

**Insulin:** This is the insulin concentration in the blood (mu U/ml). Insulin levels are critical in managing and diagnosing diabetes, as insulin is a hormone that regulates blood glucose levels.

**BMI:** Body Mass Index (BMI) is a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of their height in meters (kg/m^2). It's a measure used to classify underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obesity, which are important factors in diabetes risk.

**DiabetesPedigreeFunction:** This is a function that scores the likelihood of diabetes based on family history. It takes into account the genetic predisposition to diabetes.

**Age:** The age of the individual. Age can be a risk factor for diabetes, with the risk generally increasing as people get older.

**Outcome:** This is the target variable, indicating whether the individual has diabetes (1) or not (0).
